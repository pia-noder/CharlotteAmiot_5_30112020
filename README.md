# Create an e-commerce website #

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Start the website ###

Use any browser. After start the server, click on index.html

### Objectif ###

Part of the OpenClassRooms program (project 5). Create the front-end part of an e-commerce website by using Javascript.

### Developped skills ###

With this project I acquired javascript's basis, such as :
 
 -Class
 -Objects
 -Loops
 -Events
 -Request to a server
 -Promise / Callback (asynchronise)
 - ...

And also to start using some others tools:
-the use of URL to transfert datas from a page to another
-Local Storage
-Form Validation (Regex and constraint API)
-Bootstrap (to simplify CSS  and build the website structure faster)
